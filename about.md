Hi, I&#8217;m Paul. Right now I&#8217;m probably doing one of three things:

  * Cooking, cleaning or serving food (by day I&#8217;m a dinnerlady)
  * Plotting, scheming or running projects (by night I&#8217;m a community volunteer)
  * Pretending to be a dinosaur (I don&#8217;t think I need an excuse for this one)

  This blog is really to document the second one of those points, though expect me to get sidetracked along the way.

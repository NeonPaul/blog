## About

Hi, I'm Paul. I'm a software developer at the Natural History Museum, London. This blog is some kind of experimental diary, and a place for me to organise my thoughts on politics, activism, and decentralised systems.

I run part of a large social media network at [@paul@kith.kitchen](http://kith.kitchen/@paul).

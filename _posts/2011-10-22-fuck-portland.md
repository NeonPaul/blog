<strong style="font-size: 120%;">Why do so many bloggers live in Portland?</strong> Loads of them do, seriously. It must be blogger paradise. I bet they all sit around and have **LAN parties** and **motivational workshops** all the time there. Do you think it&#8217;s Portland that creates these people or does it attract them like **magnets** or flies?

### What the Pros are Doing

**[Jonathan Mead](http://www.illuminatedmind.net/ "Mead's website blog business adventure thing")** has been [gabbing on lately](http://www.illuminatedmind.net/2011/10/18/environment-vs-willpower/ "Johnny Mead: Environment vs. Willpower") about how your **environment** is conducive to **being a success** above everything else. He&#8217;s been saying it in the context of a **new product** he&#8217;s launching, but I bet it&#8217;s just an **ebook** that says &#8220;_move to Portland_&#8221; on every **page**.

### However

<div>
  But if there&#8217;s anything I&#8217;ve learnt from the hours and hours of time I&#8217;ve spent reading mildly popular blogs instead of getting a decent job, it&#8217;s that sometimes you just have to buck the trend and do something totally controversial.So, here is my one-point-plan:</p> 
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Fuck Portland</strong>
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>

I&#8217;ve made a decision, I think. I&#8217;ve got a little project brewing. It&#8217;s a bit different from the other projects I&#8217;ve done so it&#8217;s pretty scary, but it&#8217;s also only small.

**Stop Waiting**

With anything scary and with the possibility of failure comes resistance, and wanting to take the &#8220;best&#8221; or the &#8220;most right&#8221; or the &#8220;perfect&#8221; path. And while it&#8217;s good to weigh up the advantages of different choices, if there&#8217;s no immediate winner it&#8217;s probably just best to cut loose and go for it. The only other option is waiting around, um-ing and ah-ing.

**From You**

This post is me trying to set things in stone. I&#8217;m looking to be held slightly accountable (by you guys). I&#8217;m also looking for encouragement and support, as well as stories from you guys &#8211; are you starting anything scary and new right now, or have you done recently?

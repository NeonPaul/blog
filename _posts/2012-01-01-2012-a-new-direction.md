Well 2012 I think is going to be a year of habits.

Internet blogger Leo Babauta is a little bit of an inspiration to me. Bits of advice I picked up from his blog, [Zen Habits](http://www.zenhabits.net "Zen Habits"), sort of helped me do a lot of the things I&#8217;ve done in the past couple of years, and helped me to figure out various things about myself that I&#8217;m really quite grateful for knowing.

**New year&#8217;s habits.**

So Leo rejects the ideas of new year&#8217;s resolutions or goals. Instead he recommends trying to get into a new habit, and relishing the journey rather than being miserable because you wish you were at the destination.

> _For one thing, when you set goals, they are often arbitrary, and so you are spending all your effort working towards a basically meaningless number. And then if you don’t achieve it, you feel like you failed, even if the number was arbitrary to start with._

Hopefully after a while you&#8217;ll feel that you&#8217;re in the groove and your new habit will be, well, habitual. Then you can effortlessly continue doing that thing for the rest of your life &#8211; and get into another new habit using the same method.

**Failproof.**

I love this idea because its focus is naturally on _where you are now_ as opposed to goals, that demand you be at a certain place within a certain amount of time, regardless of what happens in between now and then &#8211; and can put an unnecessary stress in your mind.

And if you drop the habit? Well you&#8217;ve still made progress, you&#8217;ve _failed gracefully _(it&#8217;s a good thing- more about this in a later post!_)_, and you don&#8217;t feel bad about not meeting some imaginary quota.

**Bingo!**

So my first habit of 2012 is the one Leo&#8217;s proposed in his most recent post &#8211; start off 5 minutes of exercise per day, increasing by 5 minutes whenever I stop feeling the burn.

**Dudes:**

Do you think you could apply this to your own resolutions? What are some things you might give a go? Did you have a good new year&#8217;s eve?

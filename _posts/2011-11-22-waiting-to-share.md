When I write blog posts, songs or other things I want to show off to the world, I tend to want to publish them immediately. But is this really the best way to work? I&#8217;m not so sure any more.

When you&#8217;re in the moment of creation you can feel incredibly passionate about what you&#8217;re doing, to the extent that sometimes it can blind you to the imperfections. Many times I&#8217;ve uploaded a song and come back to it later with better ideas, or noticed things that I wished I had changed before letting it lose in the world.

Coming back and looking at something with a different frame of mind can be almost as valuable as having a completely different person help you out.

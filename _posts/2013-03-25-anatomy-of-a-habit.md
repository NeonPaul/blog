Leo Babauta said that to make a change in your life you just need to form a new habit. Well I suppose the first thing that I need to do is to getting into a habit of forming habits, because my life feels like a big bundle of mess right now.

<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-263" alt="anatomy of a habit" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMAG0159-300x179.jpg" width="300" height="179" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMAG0159-300x179.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMAG0159-1024x613.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />

How in the hell do you form a habit anyway?

  * Place it on a hook
  * Do one thing at a time
  * Try and try again

Well, that&#8217;s my recipe. But numbers 2 and 3 sort of contradict each other: I can&#8217;t try to form a habit every day if I&#8217;m only supposed to be focusing on one at a time.,

Instead I&#8217;ll content to writing about them. Whenever I have an evening in by myself I&#8217;ll write about them. And every now and then I&#8217;ll blog about progress. You know, to help with accountability&#8230; or just indulge my writer&#8217;s ego.

I knew that ego would come in useful at some point.

**People were blogging.** I looked at the blogs, I read the blogs, and I was compelled to update my own baby. My own strange, shapeshifting, semi-somnolent babby.

I&#8217;m not quite sure what this hunk of wordiness is. Sometimes it seems to think it&#8217;s a [productivity blog](/2013/anatomy-of-a-habit/ "Anatomy of a Habit"), on other days a [technology blog](/2013/talking-to-robots/ "Talking To Robots"), and every now and then it wants, I think, to be some kind of (post)modernist artwork.

I&#8217;ve given up trying to name it or tame it into any particular shape; it is what it is and that&#8217;s just fine. It&#8217;s a mindset that I would like to adopt in my day-to-day life&#8211; too often I find myself trying to emulate someone I admire, or [_pretending to be somebody I&#8217;m not_](/2012/arts-and-fart/). The very thing we&#8217;re not supposed to do according, presumably, to some universal law of How Humans Should Behave.

**The State Of The Machine**

Anyway, since we&#8217;re here, allow me to deliver to you a postcard.

Earlier this year I caved into the pressure of the econosphere and secured myself a job working for that great nemesis of modern middle class romantics: _The Man_. Fear not though, for I am now raging against the system _from within_ by selecting all of the slightly negative responses to internal staff satisfaction surveys.

Let me tell you, a full time job is like an horological sponge that not only sucks up the 40 hours per week that you press it down upon, but it also absorbs a certain amount of the time that happens to be too near its porous edges.

And it is this that causes the slight ironic sting when I notice myself thinking, now that Maslow&#8217;s pyramid is being stacked up in the correct order, &#8220;Boy, I really fancy _doing a load of things_&#8220;.

**Ten Weird Tips For Wizards**

So to maximise my spiritual profit margins I am leaning back on all of the lessons I learned when [training to become an internet guru](/2012/how-i-nearly-became-a-guru-but-fortunately-managed-to-avoid-it/). You know the kind of things: making lists, eating only goji berries, and reducing my dictionary of adjectives to solely the word &#8220;awesome&#8221;.

No not really, that is just my little joke. By _lessons_ I mean the kind of sorcery I can use to move my hobbies and projects around my life and stack them up so that they&#8217;ll all fit in.

Though the metaphor that initially jumps to mind to describe this scene is a game of Jenga. I sincerely hope that it&#8217;s a baseless analogy because, as I&#8217;m sure you don&#8217;t need telling, every Jenga tower eventually falls.

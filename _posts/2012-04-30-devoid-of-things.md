Well now that I&#8217;m not really going to talk about personal development any more I&#8217;m not really sure what direction to push this blog in. The well of metaphors seems to have dried up and I&#8217;m out of inspiration.

So the question falls to you: is there anything you&#8217;d like me to blog about? Things I&#8217;ve written in the past that you&#8217;d like me to expand on? Things you&#8217;re interested in that I can research? Please give me as many suggestions as you can muster!

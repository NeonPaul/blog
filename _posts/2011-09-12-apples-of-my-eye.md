It&#8217;s September, and it&#8217;s apple season.

There are loads of apple trees all over Southampton, I headed to one on the East Common, along with a few transition members and Alan Gibson, [the Urbane Forager](http://theurbaneforager.blogspot.com/2011/09/picknik-1.html).

Man, there were so many apples! And it was only one tree! I must have enough apples to last me the whole year here. If you like free apples and/or climbing trees I would highly recommend fruit foraging adventures!

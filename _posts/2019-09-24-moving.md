# Moving

I've moved to Leeds now. I have left London and now I live in Leeds.

I'm also closing my facebook account, for reasons I may go into later.

I'll post occasional updates on this blog for anyone who wants to keep up with me.

You can follow me here with [RSS](http://blog.mrkiddle.co.uk/feed.xml), get updates by email using [Blogtrottr](https://blogtrottr.com/), or on my Mastodon instance [Kith Kitchen](https://kith.kitchen/@paul).

More contact details on [my home page](http://mrkiddle.co.uk)... let's keep in touch!

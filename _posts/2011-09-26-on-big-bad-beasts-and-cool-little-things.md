Oh wow oh wow, look at all this stuff there is that needs to be done!

And look at all of these people, they&#8217;re so excited &#8211; they think your Big Thing is going to be _AMAZING_.

Oh but it&#8217;s just a Baby Thing really &#8211; you&#8217;re going to have to do so much more to live up to their expectations!

**But don&#8217;t.**

If you try to make a Big Bad Beast of a Thing and you run out of energy it will be a half-finished, unrefined giant. Everyone will have heard about it but nobody will be that impressed really. And it may step on you. Wouldn&#8217;t that be terrible.

You came here to make a Cool Little Thing, so make a Cool Little Thing. If it works people will love it. And from tiny acorns the world is your oyster.

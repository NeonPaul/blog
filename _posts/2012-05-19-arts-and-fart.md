Ra ra ra right.

In my everlasting quest to produce create produce create I sometimes feel the need to put something out there despite not having any particular burning topics to talk about.

Sometimes I read a thing and it sounds deep and interesting, and maybe I won&#8217;t even understand it all, but I will feel like I _should_ be into it and supportive of it, regardless of how much I actually agree. I feel like I _should_ agree, so I make a blog post about the thing and it just feels all wrong and forced. As if I&#8217;m _pretending to be somebody else_ which is always one of the things people say you shouldn&#8217;t do.

I really think you can tell the difference between [posts from the heart](/2012/how-i-nearly-became-a-guru-but-fortunately-managed-to-avoid-it/ "How I Nearly Became a Guru (but fortunately managed to avoid it)") and [posts made of fart](/2012/knowledge-at-your-eyelashes/ "Knowledge at your Eyelashes"). The former might be more silly but it&#8217;s definitely more me. When I struggle to get behind my own blog posts you know there is something wrong.

At some point in the next couple of months I&#8217;ll be leading a workshop on _How To Do HTML_. The cost of the workshop will be Â£5 per person, and the date will be announced once I know three or four people are interested.

The class will be small and informal, and will cover the following topics:

  * Creating an HTML document
  * What are tags, elements & attributes?
  * Introduction to doctype, html, head and body, and other common and useful tags
  * How and where to find helpful resources

Time permitting I&#8217;ll also cover more, including history and a short introduction to CSS, for adding style and colour.

It&#8217;ll be held at [The Third Age Centre](http://www.thirdagecentre.co.uk/) in Southampton, where computers will be available (though if you&#8217;d rather bring your own laptop please feel free).

If you&#8217;re interested please leave a comment or send me an email &#8211; neonpaul@gmail.com

Thanks! ðŸ™‚

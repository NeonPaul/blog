# Harvest Moon

I was sitting at the top of Primrose Hill with my friend Gaynor, looking out at the skyline of the City of London, with a beautiful orange moon just rising up behind it.

It's September's full moon, the harvest moon, a time for reaping what you've sown in the past year, and for us a time for goodbyes.

I'm leaving London for Leeds in less than a week, and I absolutely cannot wait. I love a change, and right now I really feel like I need one. As much as I've enjoyed London it doesn't feel like a real city and I've never really felt at home there.

I'm also leaving behind Facebook. Maybe a risky move to cut my digital ties as well as my geographic ones but this is a time for change, and my feelings about internet giants have only grown stronger over time, views I plan on taking about in this blog.

Finally, how to keep in touch with me?

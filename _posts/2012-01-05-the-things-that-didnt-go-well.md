I don&#8217;t want to pretend that everything I did this year was a success, because it wasn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m only human and definitely prone to failure (something I&#8217;d like to actually do more often, if we&#8217;re honest).

**Things for other people**

There was a lot of stuff that I did last year not because I wanted to, but because other people wanted me to. I thought about my reputation, and about the happiness of others, before the value of my own time.

If the things you do are primarily things that other people want, you&#8217;re going to burn out much quicker than if you&#8217;re doing things you enjoy, and finding a way for that to help other people.

**Fair?**

Do you think that&#8217;s fair to say? Or is that stupid and selfish? Let me know in the comments!

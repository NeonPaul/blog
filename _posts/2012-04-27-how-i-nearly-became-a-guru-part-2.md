_This is the second part of my story about [my addiction to personal development blogs](/2012/how-i-nearly-became-a-guru-but-fortunately-managed-to-avoid-it/ "How I Nearly Became a Guru (but fortunately managed to avoid it)")._

In the first part of my story I developed an unhealthy interest in personal development blogs. Then life turned,  I got a house I liked, had some good friends, found a job, and everything was fine. I did not need blogs at all.

Fast forward 18 months.

Still in the same job, in the same house, and to be honest I&#8217;m feeling stagnant. I don&#8217;t want to be in this situation any more, and I&#8217;m dreaming. I want a better job, more freedom, a more interesting life! This is the point where I relapse and go back on the blogs.

And it&#8217;s Jonathan Mead that catches my heart this time. I notice his blog seems to have changed somewhat, many of the articles just seem to be thinly-veiled advertisements for his coaching program, but again I sit on my cynicism and recall the image of him I have as the cool cowboy, [living the high-life in Portland](/2011/fuck-portland/ "What Johnny Mead & His Cohorts Don’t Want You To Know About Success (Plus Free Ebook!)") with loads of cash, women and fast cars&#8211; no, wait, that&#8217;s not right&#8230;

Well anyway, my workplace tell me they have to let me go and with the end of my job looming I am desperate to do anything that frees me from having to go back on the mental torture device that is jobseekers&#8217; allowance. Come on Jon, you have to save me!

Again I find that the articles and the free e-books aren&#8217;t enough. They&#8217;re ineffective and they feel like old news. Eventually I sign up to his next free webinar. &#8220;This is it!&#8221;, I think, &#8220;The way out!&#8221;. It means having to wake up at 2am on a work morning due to timezone differences, but no pain no gain right?

And I listen in. And it&#8217;s&#8230; interesting. But _still_ he&#8217;s saying all these things that I pretty much already know. It&#8217;s sort of deflating. Then it comes to the Q&A section. Here we go, someone please ask something to get a real juicy nugget of practical advice from him! But nobody does, they&#8217;re all asking questions about the six month business development course he&#8217;s offering.

Suddenly I realise: this is all an elaborate advert. All of these blogs are; each and every post is a sales pitch, a brainwashing exercise to create a narrative that says &#8220;this blogger is a success, and you want their secrets, and you will gladly give them money for it because that&#8217;s the done thing and the only thing&#8221;.

WOAH.

I&#8217;ve been living in a dream world. I was mimicing the gurus, my blog posts were poorly-constructed rehashes and recycles of lifehacking advice I had picked up while trawling the blogosphere for an escape route. My writing style was diluted and fake. The best posts I had written were the ones where I had let my cynic to come out to play and written sarcastically of my obsessions.

But I was trying to become one of them, a pro-blogger. And I nearly enrolled on that course, I nearly sent off $500 of my savings to transform myself into an inauthentic, ineffective, deluded hero. And I thank the world that I didn&#8217;t.

**The myth of progress**

I don&#8217;t disagree entirely with the concept of personal development, nor even personal development blogs. But in most cases money becomes involved. When that happens and it turns into a business model, getting customers becomes more important than helping people, so potential clients need to be reminded of that great human responsibility to grow. And it doesn&#8217;t take too much convincing because it&#8217;s a myth that is so built into our society we don&#8217;t even notice it.

I hope that in the future this blog will rely less and less on the myths people tell me, and in turn represent my own thoughts better &#8211; for what&#8217;s the point of it otherwise? But it&#8217;s a hard journey to predict, and for now I&#8217;m just happy to tell you this story. Let&#8217;s hope there isn&#8217;t a sequel.

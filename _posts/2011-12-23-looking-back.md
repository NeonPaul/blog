So we&#8217;re coming to the end of 2011, and all of the blogs are starting to do that &#8220;what I did in the past 12 months&#8221; post. I&#8217;m going to do it slightly differently.

**Home sweet home**

I&#8217;m at my Dad&#8217;s house for Christmas this year. I sat down with my brother Adam today and we both tried to come up with lists of what we did this year.

Adam&#8217;s currently studying for his GCSEs and at first he wasn&#8217;t sure he had any accomplishments other than having a good round of mock exams.

But we had a good think and came up with a bunch of other things he&#8217;s done. Trampolining, making music, work experience, arts and crafts, all sorts of things.

**Value yourself**

No matter how boring you think your life is, there are always things you can be proud of. [However small it is](/2011/on-big-bad-beasts-and-cool-little-things/ "On Big Bad Beasts and Cool Little Things").

And if there really genuinely isn&#8217;t anything? Here&#8217;s a secret: it doesn&#8217;t even matter. Some people love making lists, but you don&#8217;t need reams of achievements and goals to feel like you have any value. Just meet yourself where you are.

**On the other hand**

On the other hand if you&#8217;re [the type of person who tends to steam ahead](/2011/set-sail-for-your-destiny/ "Set Sail For Your Destiny"), then become down and disillusioned when you burn out, stopping to look at where you&#8217;ve come from can be a really uplifting activity, and can help to give you some direction for the future. Meeting yourself where you are.

**Your List**

So I&#8217;d like to hear from you now. What are some of the things you&#8217;ve done in the past year? They don&#8217;t have to be big things, they can be tiny little things, as long as you feel good that you&#8217;ve done them. Just drop them there into the comments!

Quit your job! Work from home! Be your own boss!

What a load of bollocks.

**Step one: buy boat.**

If you want to cut loose from the moorings that keep you from drifting out to sea, make sure you&#8217;ve got a course planned first. Make sure you have a structure. This is different from [um-ing and ah-ing](/2011/a-little-project-brewing/ "A Little Project Brewing"), this is [moving without rushing it](/2011/waiting-to-share/ "Waiting To Share").

Think about this: What free time to you have at the moment? What are you doing with it? What if that free time expanded to every waking hour of your day and you did exactly the same things?

Depending on your answer you may want to try and re-arrange your life without making big changes first.

But then again what do I know? I&#8217;m just a blogger.
